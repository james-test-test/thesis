# Overview

## Contents

## Problem Context
- BM3 wt & A82F/F87V has no activity towards mesotrione
## Resources Available
- Screening equipment
- Computers
## Proposed Solutions
### `rio`
- Screen BM3 mutants against a wide selection of ligands
- Train a machine learning model on BM3 sequence:substrate-specificty
- Use model to design next iterations of screening
- Use model to generate new BM3 mutants with Activity
### `evo`
- Use protein structure prediction and ligand docking to virtually screen BM3 mutants for mesotrione activity.
- Use genetic algorithm to steer screening towards more active mutants
- make and test a selection of mutants
